# website
Personal website

Trying to keep it at (c)lean as possible
Structure is something like...

* Site content is written into markdown files located in the markdown directory.
* render.py takes each markdown file and renders it as HTML in root.
* Each HTML file is also prepended with the HTML contained in style.html. Style is cribbed from  bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com.
