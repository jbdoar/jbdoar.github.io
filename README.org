#+title: My personal website

Trying to keep it as (c)lean as possible. Minimal formatting, flat file structure, and so on.

Project structure goes something like...

- Site content is written as .org files located in the =src= directory.
# * render.py takes each markdown file and renders it as HTML in the docs directory.

- Each HTML file is also prepended with the HTML contained in template.html.
That part is cribbed from [this website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/).

- Org files rendered to html in =docs= directory with =org-publish=.
