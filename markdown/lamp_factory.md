Good work if you can get it. It keeps the lights on.

The high-technologists will pay a lot to come test the mesh of their screens so they can better catch our eyes.

Technicians scan in the dark.

Organic lamps, like their tungsten counterparts, tend to become unstable with prolonged use and eventually burn out. Routine replacement is necessary to keep the line running.
