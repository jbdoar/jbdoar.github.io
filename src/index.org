A little about me:
I live at home with my wife and our two cats.
We are hoping to get a dog soon.
I have several vaguely interrelated hobbies and interests, mostly involving [[file:feedbackfeedingback.org][pretty lights and flashing colors]].
During the day I work at [[file:lamp_factory.org][the lamp factory]]. 
Sometimes I go [[file:outside.org][outside]]. 


You can reach me by email [[mailto:jbdoar@gmail.com][here]].
