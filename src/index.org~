A little [about](about.html) me: I live at home with my lovely soon-to-be wife and our two very excellent [cats](cats.html). I have several vaguely interrelated [hobbies](hobby.html) and interests, mostly involving [pretty lights and flashing colors](feedbackfeedingback.html). During the day I work at the [lamp factory](lamp_factory.html). Sometimes I go [outside](outside.html).
