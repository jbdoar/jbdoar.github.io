#+title: parable of the koala
The koala spends a lot of time in the Eucalyptus tree eating Eucalyptus leaves.
The leaves smell nice but aren't good to eat, except to the koala.
The koala is something of an expert at eating Eucalyptus leaves.
But take the koala out of the tree, and serve him the leaves on the plate, and he won't know what to do with them.
