#+title: Bowling

* Bowling
Bowling is something to do with friends.

** A few things I have learned:

- There is a technique and form which real bowlers use.
I have avoided attempting to learn it, opting instead to play [[file:my_way.org][my own way]].

- You cannot look directly at the pin you wish to hit. It knows.
