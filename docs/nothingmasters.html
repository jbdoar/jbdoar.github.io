<p>The nothing-master has knowledge.
He will tell you with some authority that it can't be done, or isn't worth doing.
Heed his advice and there won't be much worth trying at all.</p>
<p>He likes to say things like:
"That will never work,"
Or:
"Why bother?"</p>
<p>He may try quizzing you in his subject-matter of expertise to gauge how .</p>
<p>He may attempt to explain his apparent hostility when you appear crestfallen before him. 
"Believe me, I've tried, I've gone down that path, it doesn't work like that."</p>
<p>Perhaps you have schooled by a nothing-master? Or have been one yourself?</p>
