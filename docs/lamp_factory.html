<p>The lamp factory is where light is packaged and sold for a profit.</p>
<p>Good work if you can get it. It keeps the lights on.</p>
<p>The high-technologists will pay a lot to come test the mesh of their screens so they can better catch our eyes.</p>
<!---That must be important. For the c-suite, it must feel like having caught lightning in a bottle.--->
<p>Whoever it was in the c-suite that realized this probably felt they'd caught lightning in a bottle.</p>

<p>Working at the lamp factory means spending a lot of time in the dark.</p>
<p>This can be upsetting, and has led many to <a href="workplace_stoics.html">stoicism</a> as a <a href="cope.html">cope</a>.
Sometimes you hear about the moment things "clicked." It's the moment their light goes out.</p>
<p>Great Lamp in the Sky is replaced by its <a href="simulation.html">simulant</a> D65.
The technologists have coaxed it out of sand.</p>
<p>The Big Lightbulb is an idol</p>

<p>Wires burn white-hot.</p>
<p>Gases sing harmonies.</p>
<p>Technicians scan in the dark.</p>
<hr />
<p>Organic lamps, like their tungsten counterparts, tend to become unstable with prolonged use and eventually burn out. Routine replacement is necessary to keep the line running.</p>
