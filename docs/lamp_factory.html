<p>The lamp factory is where light is packaged and sold for a profit.
The high-technologists will pay a lot to come test the mesh of their screens so they can better catch our eyes.
Good work if you can get it. It keeps the lights on.</p>
<hr />
<p>Working at the lamp factory means spending a lot of time in the dark.
This can be upsetting, and has led many to <a href="workplace_stoics.html">stoicism</a>.</p>
<!--- Great Lamp in the Sky is replaced by its [simulant](simulation.html) D65.
The technologists have coaxed it out of sand.
The Big Lightbulb is an idol --->

<hr />
<p>Wires burn white-hot.</p>
<p>Gases sing harmonies.</p>
<p>Technicians scan in the dark.</p>

Periodic replacement is necessary to keep the line running.</p>
<!---How many physicists does it take to change a light bulb?--->
