<h1>Drawing a comic about a cat</h1>

<p>During a drizzly November of the soul some years ago,
I conceived that creating a sort of existential-angsty cat comic --
a webcomic about a cat trying to come to terms with its nature
(as a cat living in a world of humans) held the key to my <a href="retrospect.html">salvation</a>.
At the time I had a lot of ideas about topics it would explore:
one's role in society, the nature of identity, and different ways of being in the world.
The first attempt (to the detriment of my studies that fall) resulted in
<a href="https://acatisnotaneffectivehumanbeing.tumblr.com/page/16">this</a>.*</p>
<p>The general premise is that the cat is disturbed from its slumber
and pressured by its landlord (owner) to find work.
The cat is unable to land a job, and the bank forecloses on the landlord's home,
and they are both left out on the streets.
Encounters and misadventures in the alleys follow, wherein the cat meets various
wacky characters and ultimately learn valuable life lessons.
I reasoned I'd have <a href="epiphanies.html">figured it out</a> at that point and would
resume living in the world as an <a href="effective_human_being.html">effective human being</a>.</p>
<p>Well eventually, I got the <a href="acatisnotaneffectivehumanbeing.com">style I was looking for</a> dialed in,
consolidated many of my doodles and notes into a coherent aesthetic,
took a stab at continuing the story, and then gave up.</p>
