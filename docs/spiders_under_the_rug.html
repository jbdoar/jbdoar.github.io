<p>You can buy powerful nootropic drugs at the gas station now. They put it in the water.</p>
<p>Asleep on the couch afterward, a dream came to me: it was fantastically vivid.</p>
<p>There was a drafty house. The floors were a cold, white tile. Outside there was a patio. Maybe a pool. All vacant.</p>
<p>In the house there was a carpeted room. Gray carpets and bright stained glass. Ornate decorations. The inner sanctum of a southern preacher? That kind of vibe.</p>
<p>There was a rug. Spiders under it. A steady stream of daddy long legs. Swarming up my leg.</p>
