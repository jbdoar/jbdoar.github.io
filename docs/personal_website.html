<h1>What is the purpose of a personal website?</h1>
<p>I registered this domain (and some others, too) in a brief fit of motivation one day, now some time ago.
It occurred after a particularly stimulating conversation with a good friend of mine.
He collects domains as a hobby, and was telling me about it, and some of the clever ideas for the websites he intends to make with them.
And he suggested I make a personal website, which sounded like a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>Staking claim on a digital territory.
Marking out a little corner of the web to call and make your own.
There's gold in them hills. And so on.
It feels different than maintaining a presence on social media.
There's no one to interact with here.
I am writing into the void.
There is a sense of freedom in this.
It's just like all that uninhabited land the pioneers moved out into.</p>
<p>It's surprising what domains haven't been taken yet.
For example: I know that there's one other guy in the US with the same name as me.
But I got the domain and he didn't.
What would he put on a personal website? What will I?</p>
<p>I had better figure that part out.
Because I have some misgivings about the whole deal.
Like: what is this website about?
It's a personal website. So it's about me? What about me?
What purpose does the website serve, what sort of content is it meant to display?
What information does that betray about its author?</p>
<p>I recall a snippet of overheard-conversation between two grad students:
one was trying to persuade the other to make a personal website.
The persuadee expressed reservations to the effect that the sort of person
who maintains a personal website is likely also the sort of person who writes manifestos.
Yikes.</p>
