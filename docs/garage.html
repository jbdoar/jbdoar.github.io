<h1>The garage</h1>
<p>I'm sitting in a garage right now, which is not really my own garage but which I have more or less free reign of for the time being (never-mind how long or short that time might ultimately be), eyeing what appears to me a persistently expanding collection of tools, electronic test equipment, cameras, projectors, cathode ray tubes and more, and which at times threatens to swallow up the whole space. Like the <a href="hoarding.html">hoarders</a> and their collapsing towers of newspapers, I imagine I'll go with it.</p>
<p>I know of course, where these <a href="clutter.html">things</a> came from, and often enough, what I told myself in order to justify getting them, that these things would be useful for projects I'd have time to work on some day, when everything aligned just so-- the workshop set up, everything on hand, organized, ready to go--and sometimes things do align, and I get a little work done. Doing what, exactly, what is the "work?" This question pains me. I struggle to explain.</p>
